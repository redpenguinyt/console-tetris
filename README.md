Tetris for the console. Written in Rust using [gemini-engine](https://github.com/redpenguinyt/gemini-rust)

### Running

Download a release from the [releases page](https://github.com/redpenguinyt/console-tetris/releases), then run it from your favourite terminal emulator (Windows Terminal works best on Windows). Make sure the file is marked as executable first.

Alternatively, you can download the source and compile it with `cargo build --release` or run it immediately with `cargo run --release` (make sure to have rustup installed first)
